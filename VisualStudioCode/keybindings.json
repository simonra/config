    // Note that the key-bindings with "shift+char" are layout specific.
    // For instance to get double quotes on a norwegian layout you'd have to use "shift+2" (for some weird reason there is not a layout independent scan quote for for instance double quotes).
    // Also be aware of that, in the snippet, using $TM_SELECTED_TEXT$0 will leave the text un-selected with the cursor at the end of the text,
    // while using ${0:${TM_SELECTED_TEXT}}$0 preserves the selection and place the cursor at the end of the selection.
    // (If you had just ${TM_SELECTED_TEXT} without $0 to specify where the character should be after the selection, it would end up placed after the last wrapping character.)
